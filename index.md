## Welcome to Mil-OSS!

Welcome to the Mil-OSS website [https://mil-oss.dev](https://mil-oss.dev).  This site is for discussing the relationship of open source software (OSS) and the military. We focus on the U.S. military, the US Department of Defense (DoD).

Please join the **[Mil-OSS mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!forum/mil-oss)**!

Also see the [GitHub Mil-OSS projects site](https://github.com/mil-oss), where various projects are available.

## Key materials

* [*Software Development and Open Source Software* (2022-01-24)](https://dodcio.defense.gov/portals/0/documents/library/softwaredev-opensource.pdf) - the key DoD-wide policy on OSS. This supercedes [*Clarifying Guidance Regarding Open Source Software (OSS)* (2009)](https://dodcio.defense.gov/Portals/0/Documents/FOSS/2009OSS.pdf) [(local copy)](resources/2009OSS.pdf).

## What happened to mil-oss.org?

At one time we (the original Mil-OSS group) were hosted on mil-oss.org, but that domain was accidentally allowed to lapse and picked up by someone else.  We don't know who controls the mil-oss.org domain now.  So we've restarted our website here on [https://mil-oss.dev](https://mil-oss.dev). You can verify this by noticing that our [Mil-OSS mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!forum/mil-oss) has been operated continuously, but now refers to mil-oss.dev instead of mil-oss.org. We are very sorry for the inconvenience.
