# Modifying this site

## How to modify the site contents

The following are instructions on how to edit the site. This site is hosted on GitHub pages.

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/mil-oss/mil-oss.github.io/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.  You can also use `git clone https://github.com/mil-oss/mil-oss.github.io.git` to create a local clone to edit.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

If you don't have direct edit rights, you can still do that, but it will create a fork and pull request.  Someone else can review the pull request, and then merge it if it's appropriate.

Most of the text is in Markdown format in .md files; below is a brief explanation of Markdown if you're not familiar with it.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

The Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/mil-oss/mil-oss.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
